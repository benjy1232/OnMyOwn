These are examples from the textbook *Problem Solving with C++: Ninth Edition* by Walter Savitch.
These problems are mainly in use so that way I can get more of a feel of c++ and so I can find out how I like to program and what I don't like.
Feel free to look at this code as you please as it is from the textbook we use in class.
I will try to cite from which page I copied the code from and if I changed anything about it.
